I'm a student at Portland State University in my first term of the M.S. in Computer Science track. My background is in material science, and I did research on semiconductors in the past. After enjoying the software development part of my job way more than I should have, I decided to make a career out of it. Nowadays, I do QA at CDK Global. In my spare time, which I don't have much of (ðŸ˜Š), I enjoy hiking, cycling, and sometimes skiing.
